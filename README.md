## Description
As countries are preparing to roll out potential coronavirus vaccines early next year, questions of logistics arise. VaccFinder is a free online service where users can look for the nearest locations offering Covid-19 vaccinations. 

We want to make vaccinations easy and accessible for all, especially in a time when so many are afraid of vaccines. Through this app, once the vaccines are rolled out, we will help provide immunity through bringing people where they need to be. And by controling the spread, this app will be a crucial help in the coming transition to normalcy.

## to use
install required npm dependencies in frontend folder, and required pip dependencies in backend folder. Then set the the appropriate environment variables up, for this you will need a google maps API key.

- You can set the environment variables in frontend by setting REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000 & REACT_APP_GOOGLE_TOKEN=YOURTOKEN
- You can set the environment variables in backend by setting FLASK_APP='\_\_init\_\_.py' & API_KEY=YOURTOKEN

After this, you should be able run use flask run to run the backend, and npm run start to run the frontend. Have fun!
