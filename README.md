## Description
As countries are preparing to roll out potential coronavirus vaccines early next year, questions of logistics arise. VaccFinder is a free online service where users can look for the nearest locations offering Covid-19 vaccinations. 

We want to make vaccinations easy and accessible for all, especially in a time when so many are afraid of vaccines. Through this app, once the vaccines are rolled out, we will help provide immunity through bringing people where they need to be. And by controling the spread, this app will be a crucial help in the coming transition to normalcy.
